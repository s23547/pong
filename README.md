Hello,

This is the game i made with my classmate, when we needed a project to pass the coding classes. First thing we did was to add SFML library, which is dedicated for multi-media.
We needed graphics and audio ones, but added all of them just in case. Also there was necessity to edit a makefile. Shortly, we made some basics objects in the code, which
we then referred to. We made the shape borders for ball and game board, so that the ball wont fall out the sheet. We devided board into rectangles, so it could be easier to 
make restrictions and game design. Finally, all that remains was to give the ball speed and make the keys functionable.

J.M.
